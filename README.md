# Price-Prediction
With the help of a parser, I collected data about the cars of the Armenian market from the site auto.am. Collected 10,000 data. But it is obvious that the data needed to be processed, as there were many errors when filling in the data in the client's ads. After processing, I received data that can be used to build a machine learning model. I save it as 'auto.csv'.
